       "  '**Contiguous Bachelor\\'s/Master\\'s Pathways for UCSC Undergraduate Students**\\n===========================================================================\\nFive-year contiguous bachelor\\'s/master\\'s pathways allow UCSC undergraduate students to complete both a bachelor\\'s degree and a master of science degree in an accelerated time frame.\\nContiguous Bachelor\\'s/Master\\'s Pathways (sometimes called \"4+1\" pathways) enable\\xa0well-prepared undergraduate students to complete specific upper-division or graduate courses in the latter stages of their undergraduate degree and apply those courses toward a master’s degree once admitted to the master’s program.\\nStudents typically do not need to be enrolled in one particular major to pursue a Contiguous Bachelor\\'s/Master\\'s Pathway.\\xa0 Instead, these programs are often open to students from any major, as long as the required prerequisites are completed.\\xa0\\xa0Contiguous Bachelor\\'s/Master\\'s Pathways provide qualified undergraduate students with\\xa0increased opportunities for career and/or future academic success. Students are able to deepen their knowledge and experience in an academic field, complete both degree programs efficiently and often in a shorter time, obtain additional employment credentials, and improve their competitiveness for pursuing doctoral studies in top doctoral programs. Specific information about each pathway program\\'s eligibility requirements and application process are detailed below.\\nBiomolecular Engineering & Bioinformatics\\nBecause the bioinformatics concentration of the Biomolecular Engineering and Bioinformatics (BMEB) B.S. provides excellent preparation for a graduate program in bioinformatics, we offer a contiguous B.S./M.S. degree pathway that allows those students to complete the BMEB M.S. (or Ph.D.) program somewhat sooner than students with a less-tailored preparation.\\nYou can find more information about the BMEB Contiguous Pathway on the UCSC Catalog.\\xa0Interested students should schedule an appointment with the BMEB Graduate Student Advisor\\xa0early in their college career—no later than the end of their junior year.\\nComputer Science & Engineering\\nThe Computer Science and Engineering Contiguous 5-Year Bachelor\\'s/Master\\'s Pathway offers a competitive edge to Baskin School of Engineering (BSOE) students who are completing their undergraduate degree at UC Santa Cruz by enabling those with advanced preparation to move directly from a BSOE undergraduate program\\xa0to the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) M.S. program. The path assists qualified enrolled students with a simplified graduate application process that does not require students to take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) if they have and maintain an overall GPA of 3.0 or above by the end of their junior year until the completion of their bachelor\\'s degree. With appropriate planning, the CSE Contiguous Pathway Program makes it possible to complete a bachelor\\'s and a master\\'s in as little as five years.\\nYou can find more information about the CSE Contiguous Pathway on the UCSC Catalog. **Interested students should register by completing this online form** ideally before the end of their junior year.\\nPlease note that confirmed eligibility for this pathway\\xa0does not guarantee admission to the CSE M.S. program. **Pathway applicants\\xa0must formally apply and be admitted to the CSE M.S. program through the regular graduate admissions process, although the GRE requirement is waived.**\\nMore detailed information about this program and the application process is available on the presentation slides from our most recent CSE Pathways Workshops.\\n**NOTE:**\\xa0GRE requirement is suspended for Computer Science and Engineering M.S. applications.\\xa0You are welcome to submit your official scores, but please note the inclusion of your official GRE score will not be a deciding factor for admission.\\nElectrical & Computer Engineering\\nThe Electrical & Computer Engineering Contiguous 5-Year Bachelor\\'s/Master\\'s Pathway offers a competitive edge to students who are completing their undergraduate degree at UC Santa Cruz by enabling those with advanced preparation to move directly from a BE or other related undergraduate program to the\\xa0Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) M.S. program. The path assists qualified enrolled students with a simplified graduate application process. In order to be eligible for this program, students must have a 3.0 GPA when they apply to the B.S./M.S. contiguous pathway program, and must maintain a 3.0 GPA or higher until the completion of their undergraduate requirements. Students must also complete the required coursework pre-requisites listed in the\\xa0ECE Contiguous Pathway Catalog\\xa0entry. With appropriate planning, the ECE Contiguous Pathway Program makes it possible to complete a bachelor\\'s and a master\\'s in as little as five years.\\nInterested students should register by completing\\xa0this\\xa0online survey\\xa0and are welcome to schedule an appointment with the\\xa0ECE Graduate Student Advisor\\xa0early in their college careers—ideally before the end of their junior year. Undergraduate students are also encouraged to attend the ECE Pathways Workshops held every Fall and Spring quarter.\\nPlease note that confirmed eligibility for this pathway does not guarantee admission to the ECE M.S. program. Pathway applicants must formally apply and be admitted to the ECE M.S. program through the regular graduate admissions process, although the personal history statement and two out of three letters of recommendation are waived.\\nMore detailed information about this program and the application process is available on the\\xa0presentation slides\\xa0from our most recent ECE Pathways Workshops.\\nScientific Computing & Applied Mathematics\\nUndergraduate students currently enrolled in approved programs (currently, the B.A. in Mathematics, or the B.S. in Computer Science, the B.S. in Robotics Engineering, the B.S. in Physics, the B.S. in Applied Physics and the B.S. in Physics [Astrophysics]) have the opportunity, any time between the start of their junior year and the end of the fall quarter of their senior year, to join the 4+1 Contiguous Pathway leading to the SciCAM degree program. Qualified undergraduates from other undergraduate majors may also apply to this Pathway and their applications will be considered on a case by case basis.\\nYou can find more information about the SciCAM Contiguous Pathway on the UCSC Catalog\\xa0or on the 4+1 Information page.\\xa0 To apply to the Pathway, please schedule an appointment with the SciCAM (AM) 4+1 Coordinator.\\nStatistical Science\\nKnowledge of statistics and data science has become an indispensable tool. \\xa0However, the level of training in this area typically included in undergraduate curriculums is usually quite limited because of competing demands for student’s credit. \\xa0This Contiguous 4+1 Pathway allows highly qualified students to get a leg up in graduate school and private job applications by allowing them to gain much deeper knowledge of statistics and data science tools by jointly completing an undergraduate major and an M.S. degree in Statistical Science.\\nThe pathway is open to students from a wide variety of majors, including Computer Science, Technology Management, Economics, Mathematics and\\xa0Physics.\\xa0 Sample planners for selected majors can be accessed here.\\xa0 Students must declare their interest in pursuing this\\xa0contiguous pathway no later than their ninth quarter of study at UCSC, and more typically at the end of the sixth or seventh quarter of enrollment.\\nYou can find more information about the Statistical Science contiguous pathway on the UCSC catalog.\\xa0 To apply to the pathway, schedule an appointment with the Statistical Science Graduate Director and complete the application form.'),\n",

Degree**\\nThe 4+1 pathway into the SciCAM M.S. program is an option that allows undergraduates at UC Santa Cruz to (1) take the SciCAM foundational courses (AM 100, AM 112, AM 114, AM 129, and AM 147) during their undergraduate degree in preparation to join the 1-year track of the SciCAM program, and (2) apply to SciCAM through a streamlined application process. Undergraduate students currently enrolled in approved programs have the opportunity, any time between the start of their junior year and the end of the fall quarter of their senior year, to join the 4+1 contiguous pathway leading to the SciCAM degree program. Approved programs are:\\n* B.S. in Applied Mathematics\\n* B.S. in Astrophysics\\n* B.S. in Computer Engineering\\n* B.S. in Computer Science\\n* B.S. in Electrical Engineering\\n* B.A. in Mathematics (pure and computational)\\n* B.S. in Physics\\n* B.S in Robotics Engineering\\nQualified undergraduates from other undergraduate majors may also apply to the 4+1 pathway and their applications will be considered on a case by case basis.\\n**Admission Requirements**\\nThe requirements for admission into the 4+1 pathway are (1) a cumulative GPA of 3.3 or higher, and (2) to have taken, or to have a plan to take, at least four of the five SciCAM foundational courses before the end of their senior year. The five foundational courses are: AM 100 (Mathematical Methods for Engineers III), AM 112 (Introduction to Partial Differential Equations), AM 114 (Introduction to Dynamical Systems), AM 129 (Foundations of Scientific Computing for Scientists and Engineers), and AM 147 (Computational Methods and Applications). Note that some of the foundational courses are waived depending on the studentâ\\x80\\x99s major, or can be substituted by other courses on a case by case basis, with approval from the 4+1 coordinator.\\nInterested students should schedule a meeting with the SciCAM 4+1 pathway director to discuss their curriculum plan and fill the application form, following the guideline on the 4+1 pathway website. The ultimate deadline for application to the pathway is Dec. 1 of the senior year, although students are encouraged to apply significantly earlier, ideally at the same time as their major declaration.\\nStudents in the pathway who apply to SciCAM through the streamlined application process are not guaranteed admission, although we do expect to admit anyone who has passed all the foundational courses and has maintained a GPA of 3.3 or higher.\\n**Program Requirements**\\nOnce accepted into the SciCAM program, students from the pathway will follow the same requirements as students in the regular SciCAM program (please refer to the SciCAM catalog page), but on an accelerated one-year track with anticipated graduation in spring of their M.S. year for Plan II (comprehensive exam track) students, and the end of the summer of their M.S. year for Plan I (thesis track) students.\\n**Relationship of SciCAM Masters program and AM Doctoral Program**\\nStudents in the SciCAM M.S. program interested in an academic career will be strongly encouraged to apply to the AM Ph.D. program upon completion of their SciCAM M.S. degree. Applications are reviewed in the standard academic cycle. Students interested in applying to the AM Ph.D. program are encouraged to discuss this option with the graduate director in the fall of each year.\\n**Transfer of Credit**\\nUp to three UC Santa Cruz courses (15 credits) fulfilling the degree requirements of the SciCAM degree may be taken before beginning the graduate program. Note that this 15-credit limit does not apply to the requirements of the five foundational courses (AM 100, AM 112, AM 114, AM 129, and AM 147), which may all be taken prior to the start of the SciCAM program without penalty. However, students will still need to take courses totaling 35 credits while being graduate students to satisfy the university requirements.\\nUp to one course from other institutions may be applied to the M.S. degree course requirements. Petitions should be submitted along with the transcript from the other institution or UC Santa Cruz Extension. For courses taken at other institutions, copies of the syllabi, exams, and other course work should accompany the petition. Such petitions are not considered until the completion of at least one quarter at UC Santa Cruz.\\n**Review of Academic Progress**\\nEach year, the faculty reviews the progress of every student in the graduate programs. Students not making adequate progress toward completion of degree requirements are subject to dismissal from the program (see the UC Santa Cruz Graduate Handbook and the AM Graduate Handbook for the policy on satisfactory academic progress). Also, please refer to the Graduate Division's specific guidelines on annual student reviews.\"),\n",

UC Santa Cruz computer engineering graduates will gain a thorough grounding in the principles and practices of computer engineering and the scientific and mathematical principles upon which they are built; they will be prepared for further education (both formal and informal) and for productive employment in industry. Because computer engineering is so broad, the B.S. in computer engineering offers four specialized concentrations for completing the program: systems programming, computer systems, networks, and digital hardware\\n**Systems Programming Concentration**\\nThe systems programming concentration focuses on software systems: courses include operating systems, compilers, software engineering, and advanced programming. Students finishing this concentration are very well prepared for building large software systems of all types. This concentration is the closest one to a computer science major-the main differences are that it does not require computer science theory courses, but because of the core computer engineering requirements, includes more hardware and electronics than a computer science bachelor\\'s degree.\\n**Computer Systems Concentration**\\nThe computer systems concentration provides a balance between software and hardware design. Students are prepared for a large variety of different design tasks, especially those requiring the integration of hardware and software systems, but may need further training for any particular specialization.\\n**Networks Concentration**\\nThe networks concentration focuses on communication between computers, covering both network hardware and protocols. Students finishing this concentration are well prepared for the design of wired and wireless network systems.\\n**Digital Hardware Concentration**\\nThe digital hardware concentration focuses on hardware design and includes more electronics than the other concentrations. Students finishing this concentration are well prepared for building hardware systems. This concentration is the closest one to an electronics major; the main differences are that it does not require as much electronics theory or analog electronic design, but because of the core computer engineering requirements, requires more software skills.\\n### Program Learning Outcomes\\nFor the Computer Engineering B.S. degree, the program learning outcomes are:\\n* an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering;\\n* an ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints;\\n* an ability to function effectively on teams that establish goals, plan tasks, meet deadlines, and analyze risk and uncertainty;\\n* an ability to communicate effectively; and\\n* an ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice.\\n### Academic Advising for the Program\\nThe Baskin Engineering undergraduate advising office offers general advising for prospective and declared undergraduates majoring in Baskin Engineering programs. The office handles major declarations, transfer credits, course substitutions, articulations, and degree certifications.

In addition, completion of at least one programming course is recommended.\\n##### Cumulative GPA\\nTheir cumulative GPA should be at least 2.8 in all of the courses attempted.\\nTransfer students who wish to graduate in two years are strongly recommended to complete all lower division major requirements and most General Education requirements before coming to UC Santa Cruz.\\n#### Getting Started in the Major: Transfer Students\\nTransfer students should declare their major in their first quarter at UC Santa Cruz. Instructions for declaring a major in Baskin Engineering are on the Baskin Engineering undergraduate advising website.\\n### Major Qualification Policy and Declaration Process\\n#### Major Qualification\\nTransfer students should refer to the Transfer Admission Screening requirements.\\nIn order to declare the computer engineering major students must be listed as a proposed major within Baskin Engineering. Please refer to the Baskin Engineering \"Proposed Major Retention\" and its \"Declaring a Baskin Engineering Major\" sections in the catalog for more information.\\nIn addition to being listed as a proposed Baskin Engineering major, declaration of the computer engineering major in the first six quarters of enrollment at UC Santa Cruz is based on performance in the following lower-division courses required for the major:\\n##### CE Major Qualification Courses\\n**Both of these:**\\n| MATH 19A | Calculus for Science, Engineering, and Mathematics | 5 |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| MATH 19B | Calculus for Science, Engineering, and Mathematics | 5 |\\n##### And one of these (whichever is completed first):\\n| AM 30 | Multivariate Calculus for Engineers | 5 |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| MATH 23A | Vector Calculus | 5 |\\n##### And one of these (whichever is completed first):\\n| AM 10 | Mathematical Methods for Engineers I | 5 |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| MATH 21 | Linear Algebra | 5 |\\n##### And one of these:\\n| CSE 13S | Computer Systems and C Programming | 7 |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| ECE 13 | Computer Systems and C Programming | 7 |\\n##### And all of these:\\n| AM 20 | Mathematical Methods for Engineers II | 5 |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| CSE 12 | Computer Systems and Assembly Language and Lab | 7 |\\n| CSE 16 | Applied Discrete Mathematics | 5 |\\n| CSE 30 | Programming Abstractions: Python | 7 |\\n| PHYS 5A | Introduction to Physics I | 5 |\\n| PHYS 5L | Introduction to Physics I Laboratory | 1 |\\n| PHYS 5C | Introduction to Physics III | 5 |\\n| PHYS 5N | Introduction to Physics Laboratory III | 1 |\\nStudents in their first six quarters who have completed at least 36 credits in these courses (of the 63 total credits), will be admitted to the computer engineering major if their cumulative GPA is at least 2.8 in all of the courses listed above; and if they have attempted no more than seven credits resulting in grades of C-, D+, D, D-, F or NP in all of the courses listed above. Although all 63 credits listed above as CE Major Qualification Courses must be completed to earn the degree, only 36 of the 63 credits must be completed before declaring the major.\\n#### Appeal Process\\nStudents who are informed that they are not qualified for the major may appeal this decision by submitting a letter to the undergraduate director through the Baskin Engineering undergraduate advising office within 15 days from the date the notification was mailed. Within 15 days of receipt of the appeal, the department will notify the student, college, and Office of the Registrar of the decision.\\n#### How to Declare a Major\\nThere are four steps to declaring a Baskin Engineering major. For a detailed guide to this process, please consult the Baskin Engineering Declare Your Major website.\\nStudents should start the declaration of major process by completing Step One on the Baskin Engineering Declare Your Major website as soon as they complete 36 credits in the computer engineering major qualification courses or reach their declaration deadline quarter, whichever comes first.\\nStudents petitioning when the campus declaration deadline is imminent (i.e., in their sixth quarter, for students admitted as frosh), will either be approved, denied, or provided with conditions (e.g., completion of some courses with certain grades) that will be resolved within at most one more enrolled quarter, even if they have not completed enough courses.\\n### Letter Grade Policy\\nAll students admitted to a Baskin Engineering major, or seeking admission to a major, must take all courses required for that major for a letter grade. This policy includes courses required for these degrees that are sponsored by other departments.\\n### Course Substitution Policy\\nUndergraduate engineering students who wish to substitute a major course with a course from another department at UC Santa Cruz, or from another academic institution, must first seek approval through the Baskin Engineering Undergraduate Advising Office. The advising office requires a Petition for Course Substitution be approved before credit for an alternate course can be applied to any Baskin Engineering major requirement.\\nPetition forms are available at the Undergraduate Advising Office and online.\\nPetitions and procedures for approval must be obtained from and submitted to the Undergraduate Advising Office.\\n#### Community Colleges courses once enrolled at UCSC\\nOnce enrolled in Baskin Engineering students who wish to take a course at a California community college must first check Assist.org to see if the course is equivalent at UC Santa Cruz. If the course is not listed on Assist.org, students must submit a course substitution petition to the BE Undergraduate Advising Office to have it reviewed for equivalency. Courses that need to be reviewed must be accompanied by a course description and syllabus. It is very helpful if students can provide further evidence of course content, such as examples of programming assignments, homework, or examinations. To guarantee equivalency, departments may sometimes require a grade of B or better.\\nIf the course is approved for equivalency or was on Assist.org, then the student must also receive approval by their major department to take the class at the community college **PRIOR** to taking it. Forms and procedures for approval can be obtained from and submitted to the BE Undergraduate Advising Office.\\n#### Four-Year Institutions and the UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP)\\nStudents who intend to take a course at a four-year institution or UC Education Abroad, must submit a Course Substitution Petition to the BE Undergraduate Advising Office to have the course reviewed for equivalency. Courses that need to be reviewed must be accompanied by a course description and syllabus. It is very helpful if students can provide further evidence of course content, such as examples of programming assignments, homework, or examinations. To guarantee equivalency, departments may sometimes require a grade of B or better.\\nIf the course is approved for equivalency, then the student must also receive approval by their major department PRIOR to taking the class. Forms and procedures for approval can be obtained from and submitted to the BE Undergraduate Advising Office.\\n### Double Majors and Major/Minor Combinations Policy\\nStudents completing the computer engineering major cannot also receive the computer engineering minor or the Network and Digital Technology B.A. degree.\\n### Honors\\nMajors are considered for â\\x80\\x9cHonors in the Majorâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cHighest Honors in the Majorâ\\x80\\x9d based on their GPA and on results of undergraduate research and other significant contributions to Baskin Engineering. Students with a GPA of 3.70, in most cases, receive highest honors. Students with a GPA of 3.30, in most cases, receive honors. Students with particularly significant accomplishments in undergraduate research or contributions to Baskin Engineering may be considered with a lower GPA. Computer engineering juniors and seniors may also be eligible for election to the UC Santa Cruz chapter of Tau Beta Pi, the national engineering honor society founded in 1885.\\n### Materials Fee and Miscellaneous Fees\\nPlease see the section on fees under Baskin Engineering.\\nRequirements and Planners\\n-------------------------\\n### Course Requirements (all concentrations)\\nAll students in the computer engineering major take the same core courses, which give the fundamentals of programming and hardware design, supported by the physics and mathematics necessary to understand them.

Comparable college mathematics and science courses completed at other institutions also serve to properly prepare a student for the computer science major.\\nThis major is highly course intensive and sequential; students who intend to pursue this major must begin taking classes for the major in their first quarter at UC Santa Cruz.\\nMath placement is required for one or more of the foundational courses for this major. For more information, please review the Math Placement website.\\n### Transfer Information and Policy\\nTransfer students who want to pursue the computer science major, must have applied and been admitted to UC Santa Cruz as a proposed computer science major.\\n#### Transfer Admission Screening Policy\\nThe following Transfer Screening policy takes effect in fall 2024 and will be mandatory for all transfer students entering UC Santa Cruz fall 2026 and later. Transfer students entering UCSC prior to fall 2026 are encouraged to complete these requirements, but will still be considered for admission if they fulfill the 2023-2024 admissions screening requirements.\\nPrior to admission, transfer students must have completed the following five courses or their articulated equivalents with a combined minimum GPA of 3.0.\\nLecture-lab combinations count as one course.\\n##### All of the following\\n| CSE 12 | Computer Systems and Assembly Language and Lab | 7 |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| CSE 16 | Applied Discrete Mathematics | 5 |\\n| CSE 30 | Programming Abstractions: Python | 7 |\\n##### Plus one of the following\\n| MATH 19A | Calculus for Science, Engineering, and Mathematics | 5 |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| MATH 20A | Honors Calculus | 5 |\\n##### Plus one of the following\\n| MATH 19B | Calculus for Science, Engineering, and Mathematics | 5 |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| MATH 20B | Honors Calculus | 5 |\\n##### Minimum GPA\\nThe combined GPA in the five courses above must be at least a 3.0.\\nFurthermore, transfer students entering in the fall must have completed at least three of these courses by the end of the fall term of the previous academic year and have a minimum 3.0 GPA over all completed CS major qualification courses at that time.\\nTransfer students are strongly recommended to complete one course out of MATH 21, AM 10, MATH 23A or AM 30, and most general education requirements prior to arriving at UC Santa Cruz.\\nMost courses in the computer science program at UC Santa Cruz have a strong theoretical component to prepare the student for designing, as opposed to simply using, computer systems. Often, courses taken at other institutions which emphasize applications of current languages and computers do not count toward the computer science major at UCSC.\\nAt UCSC, computer science students are first introduced to programming using the programming language Python. The core programming sequenceâ\\x80\\x94courses CSE 30 and CSE 13Sâ\\x80\\x94exposes students to both Python and C. Many upper-division courses that involve programming use the C and C++ programming languages.\\nTransfer students who are not familiar with both an object-oriented language may need to take a remedial course. Students familiar with C++ and Unix should find the transition to Python and C relatively simple.\\n#### Getting Started in the Major: Transfer Students\\nTransfer students should declare their major in their first quarter at UC Santa Cruz. Instructions for declaring a major in the Baskin School of Engineering are on the Baskin Engineering undergraduate advising major declaration page.\\n### Major Qualification Policy and Declaration Process\\n#### Major Qualification\\nTransfer students should refer to the Transfer Admission Screening requirements.\\nFor all students, it is necessary to be listed as a proposed computer science major within Baskin Engineering before being able to declare the major. Additionally, students must satisfy the following three criteria to qualify for the CS B.S. major:\\n##### Declare\\nStudents must declare CS (Computer Science B.S. or Computer Science B.A.) as their major between studentâ\\x80\\x99s second to sixth quarter.\\n##### CS B.S. Major Qualification courses\\nStudents must have completed the following CS major qualification courses to qualify for the CS B.S. major:\\n###### Complete these three courses\\n| CSE 12 | Computer Systems and Assembly Language and Lab | 7 |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| CSE 13S | Computer Systems and C Programming | 7 |\\n| CSE 30 | Programming Abstractions: Python | 7 |\\n###### Plus one of the following\\n| MATH 19A | Calculus for Science, Engineering, and Mathematics | 5 |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| MATH 20A | Honors Calculus | 5 |\\n###### Plus one of the following\\n| MATH 19B | Calculus for Science, Engineering, and Mathematics | 5 |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| MATH 20B | Honors Calculus | 5 |\\n##### Cumulative GPA\\nStudents must also have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 in the CS major qualification courses attempted at UC Santa Cruz, with at most one unsuccessful attempt (grade C-, D+, D, D-, F, or NP) permitted in a CS major qualification course.\\n#### Appeal Process\\nStudents who are informed that they do not qualify for the major may appeal this decision by submitting a letter to the undergraduate director through the Baskin Engineering undergraduate advising office within 15 days from the date the notification was mailed. Within 15 days of receipt of the appeal, the department will notify the student, college, and Office of the Registrar of the decision.\\n#### How to Declare a Major\\nStudents interested in pursuing computer science must indicate computer science as a proposed major on their application for admission to UC Santa Cruz. Students admitted to UCSC in fall 2018 or later will be able to declare a computer science major only if they have been admitted to UCSC as proposed computer science majors.\\nThere are four steps to declaring a Baskin Engineering major. For a detailed guide to this process, please consult Baskin Engineering\\'s Declare Your Major website.\\nStudents should start the declaration of major process by completing Step One on the Baskin Engineering Declare Your Major website as soon as they complete the CS major qualification courses or reach their declaration deadline quarter, whichever comes first.\\nStudents petitioning when the campus declaration deadline is imminent (i.e., in their sixth quarter, for students admitted as frosh), will either be approved, denied, or provided with conditions (e.g., completion of some courses with certain grades) that will be resolved within at most one more enrolled quarter, even if they have not completed all CS major qualification courses.\\n### Letter Grade Policy\\nAll students admitted to a Baskin Engineering major, or seeking admission to a major, must take all courses required for that major for a letter grade. This policy includes courses required for these degrees that are sponsored by other departments.\\n### Course Substitution Policy\\nUndergraduate engineering students who wish to substitute a major course with a course from another department at UC Santa Cruz, or from another academic institution, must first seek approval through the Baskin Engineering Undergraduate Advising Office. The advising office requires a Petition for Course Substitution be approved before credit for an alternate course can be applied to any Baskin Engineering major requirement.\\nPetition forms are available at the Undergraduate Advising Office and online.\\nPetitions and procedures for approval must be obtained from and submitted to the Undergraduate Advising Office.\\n#### Community Colleges courses once enrolled at UCSC\\nOnce enrolled in Baskin Engineering students who wish to take a course at a California community college must first check Assist.org to see if the course is equivalent at UC Santa Cruz. If the course is not listed on Assist.org, students must submit a course substitution petition to the BE Undergraduate Advising Office to have it reviewed for equivalency. Courses that need to be reviewed must be accompanied by a course description and syllabus. It is very helpful if students can provide further evidence of course content, such as examples of programming assignments, homework, or examinations. To guarantee equivalency, departments may sometimes require a grade of B or better.\\nIf the course is approved for equivalency or was on Assist.org, then the student must also receive approval by their major department to take the class at the community college **PRIOR** to taking it. Forms and procedures for approval can be obtained from and submitted to the BE Undergraduate Advising Office.\\n#### Four-Year Institutions and the UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP)\\nStudents who intend to take a course at a four-year institution or UC Education Abroad, must submit a Course Substitution Petition to the BE Undergraduate Advising Office to have the course reviewed for equivalency. Courses that need to be reviewed must be accompanied by a course description and syllabus. It is very helpful if students can provide further evidence of course content, such as examples of programming assignments, homework, or examinations. To guarantee equivalency, departments may sometimes require a grade of B or better.\\nIf the course is approved for equivalency, then the student must also receive approval by their major department PRIOR to taking the class. Forms and procedures for approval can be obtained from and submitted to the BE Undergraduate Advising Office.\\n### Double Majors and Major/Minor Combinations Policy\\nStudents may not receive both the Computer Science B.A. and Computer Science B.S. degrees.\\nStudents may not receive both the Network and Digital Technology B.A. and the Computer Science B.S. degrees.\\n### Honors\\nStudents must obtain a GPA of 3.8 or higher in the courses in the major to be considered for the distinction of \"Highest Honors in the Major.\" Students must obtain a GPA of 3.5 or higher in the courses in the major to be considered for the distinction of \"Honors in the Major.\" Baskin Engineering reserves the right to withhold honors based on other criteria, such as an incident of academic dishonesty.\\nRequirements and Planners\\n-------------------------\\n### Course Requirements\\nThis program is designed for students who wish to maximize exposure to computer science concepts and methods by taking a large selection of upper-division computer science courses, as well as courses in the sciences and mathematics. A minimum of 22 courses, or 23 without the test out, must be completed for the B.S. in computer science.**\\\\***\\n**\\\\*Revised:** 8/12/24\\n#### Lower-Division Courses\\n##### Computer Science and Engineering\\n###### All of the following\\n| CSE 12 | Computer Systems and Assembly Language and Lab | 7 |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| CSE 16 | Applied Discrete Mathematics | 5 |\\n| CSE 20 | Beginning Programming in Python | 5 |\\n| CSE 30 | Programming Abstractions: Python | 7 |\\n| CSE 40 | Machine Learning Basics: Data Analysis and Empirical Methods | 5 |\\nStudents with no prior programming will take CSE 20 before CSE 30, and CSE 12.

If a lecture has a lab offered (required or optional), the lab must be passed to count for this requirement.\\n#### Disciplinary Communication (DC) Requirement\\nStudents of every major must satisfy that major\\'s upper-division Disciplinary Communication (DC) requirement.\\nThe DC requirement in computer science B.S. is satisfied by completing an additional course from the following options.\\n|  | Either one of these courses |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| CSE 115A | Introduction to Software Engineering | 5 |\\n| CSE 185E /CSE 185S | Technical Writing for Computer Science and Engineering | 5 |\\n| CSE 195 | Senior Thesis Research | 5 |\\nCourse CSE 195 may be used either as an elective, or to satisfy the DC requirement, but not for both.\\n#### Comprehensive Requirement\\nIn addition to the above requirements, students must satisfy one of the following two exit requirements: pass one of the capstone courses (see Capstone Courses below); or successfully complete a senior thesis. A passed capstone course also counts toward satisfying the minimum number of upper-division electives requirement.\\n##### Capstone Courses\\nStudents may choose from one of the following capstone courses to satisfy their exit requirement (lecture-lab combinations count as one course):\\n| CSE 110B | Fundamentals of Compiler Design II | 5 |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| CSE 115C | Software Design Project II | 5 |\\n| CSE 115D | Software Design Project - Accelerated | 5 |\\n| CSE 121 | Embedded System Design | 7 |\\n| CSE 134 | Embedded Operating Systems | 5 |\\n| CSE 138 | Distributed Systems | 5 |\\n| CSE 140 | Artificial Intelligence | 5 |\\n| CSE 143 | Introduction to Natural Language Processing | 5 |\\n| CSE 144 | Applied Machine Learning: Deep Learning | 5 |\\n| CSE 145 | Introduction to Data Mining | 5 |\\n| CSE 156 | Network Programming | 5 |\\n| CSE 156L | Network Programming Laboratory | 2 |\\n| CSE 157 | Internet of Things | 7 |\\n| CSE 160 | Introduction to Computer Graphics | 7 |\\n| CSE 161 | Introduction to Data Visualization | 5 |\\n| CSE 161L | Data Visualization Laboratory | 2 |\\n| CSE 162 | Advanced Computer Graphics and Animation | 5 |\\n| CSE 162L | Advanced Computer Graphics and Animation Laboratory | 2 |\\n| CSE 163 | Data Programming for Visualization | 5 |\\n| CSE 168 | Introduction to Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality | 7 |\\n| CSE 181 | Database Systems II | 5 |\\n| CSE 183 | Web Applications | 5 |\\n| CSE 184 | Data Wrangling and Web Scraping | 5 |\\n| CSE 187 | Full Stack Web Development II | 5 |\\n| CMPM 172 | Game Production Studio | 7 |\\nStudents taking one of the capstone courses will enroll normally. Students need to pass the capstone course to pass the exit requirement. No course may be attempted more than twice without prior approval from the chair of the department offering the course. Withdrawals count as an attempted class for this purpose.\\n##### Senior Thesis\\nThe senior thesis consists of a self-contained project within the broad scope of computer science, but one that is not available in the regular course offerings. A student wishing to complete a senior thesis must successfully complete a minimum of 5 credits in CSE 195, Senior Thesis Research. The supervision of a senior thesis student is always at the discretion of the faculty member.\\nThe student first submits a written thesis proposal and obtains approval of a faculty sponsor. Then the student submits a written draft and makes an oral presentation to a faculty examining committee. After receiving feedback from the examining committee, the student submits one or more additional drafts, until the final draft is approved by the examining committee. The total amount of writing shall be consistent with the campus Disciplinary Communication requirement. A passing grade in CSE 195 is earned when the final thesis is approved.\\n| CSE 195 | Senior Thesis Research | 5 |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n### Planners\\nThe tables below are for informational purposes and do not reflect all university, general education, and credit requirements.

You can review your math skills for free to prepare you for placement or your next course. It takes up to three business days for ALEKS PPL placement to be posted in your student record. Completing the assessment by August 5 will ensure your placement is posted before enrollment begins for fall. * Students with programming experience, who wish to bypass the introductory programming course (CSE 20) should take the online CSE 20 testout exam on July 17 at 6:00pm PDT. This test requires that students register by 5:00pm PDT on July 16. See CSE 20 Testout Exam for more information and to register. |\\n| ...and should take these courses their first term: | Please DO NOT enroll in Math 11A, AMS/Econ 11A. Only MATH 19A, 19B, and AM 30 or 23A are acceptable calculus requirements for these majors. AM 30 is recommended over Math 23A for most Engineering majors. Students who want to take AM 30 must have completed Math 19B and AM 10 before enrolling.

       "  \"**Computer Science & Engineering**  \\nThe Computer Science and Engineering Contiguous 5-Year Bachelor's/Master's Pathway offers a competitive edge to Baskin School of Engineering (BSOE) students who are completing their undergraduate degree at UC Santa Cruz by enabling those with advanced preparation to move directly from a BSOE undergraduate program to the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) M.S. program. The path assists qualified enrolled students with a simplified graduate application process that does not require students to take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) if they have and maintain an overall GPA of 3.0 or above by the end of their junior year until the completion of their bachelor's degree. With appropriate planning, the CSE Contiguous Pathway Program makes it possible to complete a bachelor's and a master's in as little as five years.  \\nPlease note that confirmed eligibility for this pathway does not guarantee admission to the CSE M.S. program. **Pathway applicants must formally apply and be admitted to the CSE M.S. program through the regular graduate admissions process, although the GRE requirement is waived.**  \\n**NOTE:** GRE requirement is suspended for Computer Science and Engineering M.S. applications. You are welcome to submit your official scores, but please note the inclusion of your official GRE score will not be a deciding factor for admission.\"),\n",

       "  '**4+1 Contiguous Pathway leading to the SciCAM M.S. Degree**\\nThe 4+1 pathway into the SciCAM M.S. program is an option that allows undergraduates at UC Santa Cruz to (1) take the SciCAM foundational courses (AM 100, AM 112, AM 114, AM 129, and AM 147) during their undergraduate degree in preparation to join the 1-year track of the SciCAM program, and (2) apply to SciCAM through a streamlined application process. Undergraduate students currently enrolled in approved programs have the opportunity, any time between the start of their junior year and the end of the fall quarter of their senior year, to join the 4+1 contiguous pathway leading to the SciCAM degree program. Approved programs are:\\n* B.S. in Applied Mathematics\\n* B.S. in Astrophysics\\n* B.S. in Computer Engineering\\n* B.S. in Computer Science\\n* B.S. in Electrical Engineering\\n* B.A. in Mathematics (pure and computational)\\n* B.S. in Physics\\n* B.S in Robotics Engineering\\nQualified undergraduates from other undergraduate majors may also apply to the 4+1 pathway and their applications will be considered on a case by case basis.\\n\\n**Admission Requirements**\\nThe requirements for admission into the 4+1 pathway are (1) a cumulative GPA of 3.3 or higher, and (2) to have taken, or to have a plan to take, at least four of the five SciCAM foundational courses before the end of their senior year. The five foundational courses are: AM 100 (Mathematical Methods for Engineers III), AM 112 (Introduction to Partial Differential Equations), AM 114 (Introduction to Dynamical Systems), AM 129 (Foundations of Scientific Computing for Scientists and Engineers), and AM 147 (Computational Methods and Applications). Note that some of the foundational courses are waived depending on the student’s major, or can be substituted by other courses on a case by case basis, with approval from the 4+1 coordinator.\\n\\nInterested students should schedule a meeting with the SciCAM 4+1 pathway director to discuss their curriculum plan and fill the application form, following the guideline on the 4+1 pathway website. The ultimate deadline for application to the pathway is Dec. 1 of the senior year, although students are encouraged to apply significantly earlier, ideally at the same time as their major declaration.\\n\\nStudents in the pathway who apply to SciCAM through the streamlined application process are not guaranteed admission, although we do expect to admit anyone who has passed all the foundational courses and has maintained a GPA of 3.3 or higher.\\n\\n**Program Requirements**\\nOnce accepted into the SciCAM program, students from the pathway will follow the same requirements as students in the regular SciCAM program (please refer to the SciCAM catalog page), but on an accelerated one-year track with anticipated graduation in spring of their M.S. year for Plan II (comprehensive exam track) students, and the end of the summer of their M.S. year for Plan I (thesis track) students.'),\n",
